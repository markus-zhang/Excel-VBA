Put everything in the same folder and run with Numpy and Scipy (I use Anaconda)
This is for Case study IV.2.4 of "Market Risk Analysis", Carol used Excel so I figured it might help to use Python
BTW I don't know why but if you compare the eigenvectors from Numpy and Matrix.xla, only the first column has the same sign.
Both are actually correct, as you can multiply an eigenvector with C and both are valid eigenvectors.
So I have to invert the sign of the vectors to get the same result
