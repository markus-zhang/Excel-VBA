# Excel-VBA
This part of the website contains my practices and studies in Visual Basic for Applications, a Turing-Complete scripting language.
The contents are divided into two parts:
**Studies** and **Scripts**
I'd like to know as much as possible about the scripting language, and as deep as possible.
